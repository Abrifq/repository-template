# Abrifq's Repository Template

Hot take but tabs DO belong in markdown files. This template makes sure you use tabs in markdown files and markdownlint doesn't complain about using hard (real) tabs.

Use this repository as a template by pressing the "Use this template" or by using `gh repo create --template=Abrifq/repository-template --source=<folder>` when creating a new git repo.

Batteries not included (a.k.a. install markdownlint to your globals/extensions yourself.)
