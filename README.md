# Abrifq's Repository Template

Hot take but tabs DO belong in markdown files. This template makes sure you use tabs in markdown files and markdownlint doesn't complain about using hard (real) tabs.

Use this repository as a template by pressing the "Use this template" or by using `gh repo create --template=Abrifq/repository-template --source=<folder>` when creating a new git repo.

Batteries not included (a.k.a. install markdownlint to your globals/extensions yourself.)

Also,

## Remember to change the Readme.md and LICENSE files after importing
===

The license is Unlicense, which means you do not have to provide a copy or keep using the same license as the template. Feel free to remove it, use your own, use the template to make private software or whatever else you may like.

Have fun writing markdown documents, because this will save you from weird markdown quirks. (bugs/implementations that vary from renderer to renderer)
